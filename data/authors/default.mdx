I have experience in web development, and the industry involves informatization, government affairs, pets, and e-commerce over five years.

My expertise in technology includes JavaScript, Vuejs, Reactjs, Uniapp, Nodejs, Nuxt Serverless, Java, Python Crawler, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis etc.

The products I have developed mainly include portal websites, backend management systems, and WeChat mini programs.

I usually have a hobby of developing plugins and technical communication, and I'll ride a bike outdoors when I'm free.
